# Parallel Programming
A great course I took in Spring 2015 with Prof. Rezaul A. Chowdhury at Stony Brook University.

We explored algorithms and techniques for programming state-of-the-art shared-memory (e.g., multicores) and distributed-memory parallel computers. The course included both theoretical and programming components. Topics covered: analytical modeling of parallel programs, bounds on parallel performance, scheduling, synchronization, programming using the message-passing paradigm and for shared address-space platforms, parallel algorithms for dense matrix operations, sorting, searching, graphs, computational geometry, and dynamic programming, concurrent data structures, and transactional memory.

This course was supported by an educational grant from XSEDE (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment). I used the computing environment provided by XSEDE for all homeworks and projects.

I used the cilkplus platform (https://www.cilkplus.org) for all parallel code.
